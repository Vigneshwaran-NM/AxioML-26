# Hackathon Webpage Implementation Plan

# Goal Description
Create a premium, high-level, and aesthetic landing page for a college hackathon. The page will be a single-page static site with dynamic elements and animations. It will feature placeholders for content that can be easily updated later.

## User Review Required
- **Design Style**: Going for a "Dark Mode" aesthetic with neon/glassmorphism accents as it's a popular choice for hackathons and allows for "high-level" feel.
- **Tech Stack**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No framework (React/Next.js) is strictly necessary for a landing page, ensuring fast load times and simple hosting on a college domain.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
Root directory: `d:/Viki/Hack`

#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///d:/Viki/Hack/index.html)
- Main entry point.
- Semantic HTML5 structure.
- Sections: Hero, Overview, Problem Statements, Location.

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///d:/Viki/Hack/style.css)
- Global styles.
- CSS Variables for easy theming.
- Flexbox/Grid layouts.
- Animations (Keyframes, Transitions).
- Responsive media queries.

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///d:/Viki/Hack/script.js)
- DOM manipulation for dynamic effects.
- Scroll observer for "reveal on scroll" animations.
- Smooth scrolling navigation.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Open `index.html` in the browser.
- Verify animations trigger on scroll.
- Check responsiveness on mobile/desktop dimensions.
- Test "Register" button link.
